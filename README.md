# Acrylic

**Acrylic is, put simply, an OS that runs in your browser.**\
Despite not being an actual OS which runs on top of hardware, it acts basically as an OS. You can install apps, edit files, etc.

Currently, the latest stable version is **0.1.6**. 0.2.0 is currently in development, with **0.2.0-b11** being the latest beta release.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Acrylic is currently in alpha, so a lot of things are broken or just haven't been implemented yet.

## Contributing

Now that Acrylic is open-source (actually source-available), everyone, including *you*, can contribute.

If you find a bug, want to make a feature request, or anything in between, feel free to make an issue. If you know just a bit of frontend web development and have something to contribute, also feel free to make a PR.
