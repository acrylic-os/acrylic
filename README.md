# Acrylic

**Acrylic is, put simply, an OS that runs in your browser.**\
Despite not being an actual OS which runs on top of hardware, it acts basically as an OS. You can install apps, edit files, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Acrylic is currently in alpha, so a lot of things are broken or just haven't been implemented yet.

## Contributing

Now that Acrylic is open-source (actually source-available), everyone, including *you*, can contribute.

If you find a bug, want to make a feature request, or anything in between, feel free to make an issue. If you know just a bit of frontend web development and have something to contribute, also feel free to make a PR.
